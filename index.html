        <h2>About This Server</h2>
        <p>In this server, the cornerstone of creativity lies in ACFs expansive crafting system. Unlike standard
            gameplay, where crafting is often limited to predefined recipes, ACF3 enables players to combine materials,
            structures, and even behaviors to engineer entirely new creations. Imagine constructing intricate machinery,
            awe-inspiring monuments, or fantastical landscapesâ€”all crafted from the ground up using ACFs intuitive
            tools.</p>

                            <li>4c. You must know that being in PVP means that all people can kill you.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>5c. Changing the size of your player model in PVP is prohibited and should not be used;
                                this
                                will get you warned.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>6c. No-clip in PVP is strictly forbidden. If you fail to stop, we will strip you of the
                                no-clip command.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>7c. Using ACF against people/infantry is okay, but if they do not have any tech at hand,
                                please take note of that since not everyone is as privileged as you with vehicles, etc.
                                (As
                                well as daktek/daktank)</li>

                            <li>8c. If you make a base, there needs to be a door that opens and closes with a keypad or
                                scanner.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>9c. You can use anti no-clip areas in your bases, but please make sure you enable it for
                                administrators.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>10c. It is forbidden to Prop kill; it is against the rules.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>11c. Prop push is not allowed.</li>
